## Recommendations
- **Pause Time Goals**: When you evaluate or tune any garbage collection, there is always a latency versus throughput trade-off. The G1 GC is an incremental garbage collector with uniform pauses, but also more overhead on the application threads. The throughput goal for the G1 GC is 90 percent application time and 10 percent garbage collection time. Compare this to the Java HotSpot VM parallel collector. The throughput goal of the parallel collector is 99 percent application time and 1 percent garbage collection time. Therefore, when you evaluate the G1 GC for throughput, relax your pause time target. Setting too aggressive a goal indicates that you are willing to bear an increase in garbage collection overhead, which has a direct effect on throughput. When you evaluate the G1 GC for latency, you set your desired (soft) real-time goal, and the G1 GC will try to meet it. As a side effect, throughput may suffer. See the section [Pause Time Goal](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/g1_gc.html#pause_time_goal) in [Garbage-First Garbage Collector](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/g1_gc.html#garbage_first_garbage_collection) for additional information.
